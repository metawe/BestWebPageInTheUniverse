       <h1>About this webpage</h1>
       <p id="about_text">This is a personal website made with the help of Dreamweaver CS5. It contains school work from the ICT 11 class including two movies edited in Windows Movie Maker, 2 Flash projects, a music player and a movie player (where the two movies run from) and about the person who made it, me. To navigate the website click on the navigation bar above and the footer below. 
       <br />
       <br />
       The layout of this page was made (almost) entirely be me starting from scratch, so you can imagine how badly written it is. Most of it due to me being oblivious to the fact that you could do absolute or even relative positioning simply by declaring it beforehand, instead of using margin-top/botton/left/right. Oh well. Another problem I've had is compatibility with Internet Explorer. Even IE 9 has problems when displaying the top bar probably due to it not letting you remove the borders made when something has a link, at least not by normal CSS ways.
       <br />
       The only thing not made by me is the javascript used on the images in the Blender page. I've just always liked Highslide JS, which is that style of photo viewing which zooms in when clicked.

       <h1>Links</h1>
       <p id="link_text">
       Here are some external links to a file-sharing I personally like, Mediafire. The links direct you to a page where you can download most of the files I worked with (as in the .fla, .blender, .swf, the videos in .flv format and this whole site; all of them are compressed in .zip format.) so you can open them if you wish. Think of it as open-source stuff!
