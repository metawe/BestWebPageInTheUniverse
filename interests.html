    <h1>Programming</h1>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <h3>Violin</h3>

    <div id="ruby">
    <div id="ruby_img"><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"><img src="images/ruby_on_rails.jpg" alt="Ruby On Rails"/></a></div>
      <div id="ruby_text">Ruby On Rails is an open-source web application framework for the Ruby language. It facilitates adapting applications written in Ruby to be embedded on websites. The Ruby language itself is an object-oriented programming language based on Perl and Smalltalk. It was originally designed by a japanese team favoring convention and simplicity over configuration.
      <br />
Ruby is just one of the programming languages I am interested in and learning about. It is my focus at the moment since I plan to study software engineering in the future.

       <div id="music">
        <div id="music_img"><a href="http://olafurarnalds.com/"><img src="images/ATHETWOD.jpg" alt="Olafur Arnalds - ...And They Have Escaped The Weight Of Darkness"/></a></div>
        <div id="music_text">Ólafur Arnalds is my current favorite musician. His style is often described as minimalstic or contemporal classical. But since music genres are often confusing, there are some examples in the Flash page.
        <br />
        I got interested in contemporal classical music originally by listening to my father's "Rondò Veneziano" CDs. They are another group in the same genre, but focus on a Baroque theme. 
        </div>
        
     </div>
     <div id="violin">
      <div id="violin_img"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin"><img src="images/violin.jpg" alt="Violin and bow picture"/></a></div>
      <div id="violin_text">The violin is a 4-stringed instrument and the highest-pitched member of its string family. It is usually played by drawing the bow across each string and user the other hand to make a wider range of pitches. 
      <br /> 
      I became interested in violin almost as the same time I listened more to contemporal classical music as mentioned in the last section. I have started actually taking lessons and I sound terrible at the moment. Yay.

     <div id="Titles2">
     <h1>Science</h1>
     <h2>Books</h2>
     <h3>Games</h3>
     </div>
     <div id="astronomy">
      <div id="astronomy_img"><a href="http://www.astronomynow.com/"><img src="images/helix_nebula.jpg" alt="Color-composite of the Helix Nebula"/></a></div>
      <div id="astronomy_text">
      The image above is a colour-composite of the Helix platary nebula. It is just one of the space phenomenons I find fascinating. I've always been interested in science in general. But after researching more, I found how amazing space is containing all the strange phenomenons we barely know about. But that isn't the only thing that fascinated me. Particle physics did as well. It is the study of the existance and interactions of particles that constitute matter and radiation. 
      <br />
      It may seem like these two are vastly different, just by looking at the sizes of what they deal with, however, they are surprisingly similar in how weird are the things they find. Not only that, but the large amount of things we don't understand yet give opportuinies in which one can contribute in the future.

     <div id="books">
      <div id="books_img"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"><img src="images/1984.jpg" alt="1984 book cover"/></a></div>
      <div id="books_text">
      The book above as you can guess is Nineteen Eight-Four. It is the first book I consciously read instead of just skimming through important scenes. It still is my current favorite book and after reading George Orwell's other novels, he has become my favorite writer partly because of the simplicity of his sentences when comparing his dystopian novel to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. But anyway, my favorite genre, or rather subgenre is dystopian fiction. Most recently, I've been reading The Chrysalids and The Handmaid's Tale.

      <div id="games_img"><a href="http://supergiantgames.com/?page_id=242"><img src="images/Bastion.jpg" alt="Bastion logo" /></a></div>
      <div id="games_text">
The first game I remember playing was a puzzle  game called "Lose Your Marbles" for the PC. I got it as a Christmas gift along with a few other games in 1998, I was 4 years old. Since then, I have played dozens of games and liked some more than others. The one on the picture, Bastion, is one of the last ones I've played and my current favorite game. It is the debut game of a small company called "Supergiant Games"; I like it to the point where I would love to work there once I graduate, even if that means moving.
